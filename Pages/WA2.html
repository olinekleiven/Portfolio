        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The quote, “Interaction designers will notice that the way they’re holding the device affects the area of the screen they can comfortably reach” (Kalbag, 2017, p. 44), caught my attention. Kalbag gives an example of three people sending a message in different ways: one uses the thumb of the same hand holding the phone, one uses both hands, and one uses voice recognition.</p>
        
        <h2>The analysis</h2>
        <p>I analyzed Facebook mobile interface and assessed how it suited the different methods of interaction: one-handed use, two-handed use and voice recognition. I evaluated this by performing a people search and submitting a friend request.</p>
        <p><strong>One-handed use:</strong> The search bar was difficult to reach due to its location at the top of the screen. However, typing and sending a friend request was fine, as the keyboard and "Add Friend" button were centrally located.</p>
        <p><strong>Two-handed use:</strong> As expected this worked without any issues for both searching and sending requests.</p>
        <p><strong>Voice recognition:</strong> Facebook did not have built-in voice recognition for searching or sending friend requests, which makes it less accessible for users who rely on voice control. This suppressed me a little, as I feel that many websites have, in one way or another, begun to facilitate and implement this. Technology such as voice recognition can make the web more accessible to users with cognitive or motor impairments. (Kalbag, 2017, p. 14).</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The search function could have been placed further down the page, so it would have been more accessible for one-handed use. Surprisingly, Facebook lacked voice search functionality. This makes (Kalbag, 2017, p. 19) the platform less accessible for people with, for example, motor impairments, such as CP. By implementing this, Facebook can improve accessibility and allow a wider range of users to engage independently on the platform.</p>
