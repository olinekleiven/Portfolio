                Hi, my name is Oline, I am 22 years old, and I am from Leikanger in Sogn. 
                I am a student at the University of Bergen with a creative mind and a passion for visual design.
                I like to make things that look visually beautiful, and that can also make it easier for everyone to use. 
                I can find interest in a lot of things, as soon as something about making things 
                look visually good I find this interesting, everything from making maps in ArcGIS to creating web pages in HTML. 
                My passion is universal design.
            </p>
