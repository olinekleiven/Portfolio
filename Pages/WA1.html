        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>In this assignment, I assessed 15 different website designs from Csszengarden, and selected my 3 favorites and ranked them.</p>
        
        <h2>Bronze place:</h2>
        <p><strong>Garden Party</strong></p>
        <p>This website stood out for its cool design and unique look compared to the others. The colors attract attention, and the contrast between text and background is good. The website is well structured and works well on both the computer and mobile device. However, there is a strange scrolling function that allows you to swipe away on the mobile device, felt strange and uninformed.</p>
        
        <h2>Silver place:</h2>
        <p><strong>Oceanscape</strong></p>
        <p>This was the first site that fascinated me because I felt like I was diving for fish in a tropical ocean. When I tested it on mobile and iPad devices, some of the fish overlapped the text, which made it a bit difficult to read, but on the other hand, this enhanced the feeling of being on a diving trip and appealed to my senses. The design still looks cool, especially how the water darkens as you scroll. This contrast between the lighter and darker parts gives depth and helps to create an interesting experience, avoiding visual boredom (Golombisky & Hagen, 2010, page 51). The fish could have been structured in a better way so that the text is easier to read on mobile devices.</p>
        
        <h2>Golden place:</h2>
        <p><strong>Mid Century Modern</strong></p>
        <p>This website had a cool layout and a creative design. The first impression was that this reminded me of a website for an IT company, where UX designers had created the website. The fun shapes really catch my attention and keep me interested (Golombisky & Hagen, 2010, page 6), which are examples of good graphic design. The website looks good on a computer screen, mobile screen and tablet. There is also a rich use of color, which I like as it creates good associations and makes me feel satisfied while using the website. The contrast between text and background is good, which makes everything user-friendly and easy to read.</p>
