<!-- no matter how long I've been playing with this, I always found new things I could do and improve
I would like that when you click on each hobby section here, it just came up, and the start of your new hobby
was hidden as usual. I tried to give the different shared ideas, specify the height of each hobby section, but I couldn't get it
to work as I wanted. That's what I should have improved here. On the otehr hand, the site looks great -->
