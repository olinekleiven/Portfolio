            <p>The most important thing you can do is prioritize sleep
               the priority list and not actively opting it out in favor of
               other activities. Sleep is a basic need that we must meet
               to keep ourselves healthy and function in everyday life, in the same way as to
               <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/27-health-and-nutrition-tips">eat</a>.

            <p>It is a paradox how we relate so differently to ours
               basic needs to eat and sleep. There is almost none
               which prioritizes eating away. On the contrary, we listen almost too well
               to the body's hunger signals, with the result that
               <a href="https://nhi.no/kosthold/overvektfedme/overvekt-hva-er-det">overweight</a> 
               has become one of our biggest societal problems, literally.
               The body's sleep signals, on the other hand, we simply ignore, and we choose
               other activities than sleeping. It also makes us sick. Mine
               My first advice to my patients is therefore: Don't take sleep for granted!
            </p>
            <p>The second piece of advice is about regularity. To get sufficient
               with sleep, it is important to have a good sleep rhythm. Many struggle to
               sleep because they go to bed - and get up - at different times
               during the week. Our sleep rhythm is controlled, among other things, by the hormone
               <a href="https://www.apotek1.no/livsstil/sovn/reseptfri-melatonin?srsltid=AfmBOorl4GaOtqiRKwymNDqJvq3PvM-EmpgBQ49S-KjibF_aE6Bun8D5">melatonin</a>, 
               which signals to our brain that we should sleep. The secretion of
               melatonin is disrupted if we have an irregular sleep rhythm,
               which makes it both harder to fall asleep and to wake up. Not only
               regularity in the sleep rhythm will lead to more, and better, sleep
               will also give patients more health benefits. An example of where
               important sleep rhythm is, we find at
               <a href="https://www.helse-bergen.no/nasjonal-kompetansetjeneste-for-sovnsykdommer-sovno/skiftarbeidslidelse/">shift workers</a>, 
               which alternates between sleeping during the day and at night, depending
               job rotation. This is a group of people who are almost all struggling
               with getting good sleep, due to a natural lack of one
               regular sleep rhythm. My other advice to my patients is:
               Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, regardless of whether it is
               weekday or weekend.
            </p>
            <p>The third piece of advice is about creating the right conditions for sleep.
               Avoiding caffeine, nicotine and other stimulants recently
               the couple of hours before going to bed is something as good as everyone has
               heard of. However, few know how long caffeine, from coffee, stays in
               the body. The half-life of caffeine is as long as 3.5-5 hours
               that if you go to bed at 11pm, you shouldn't drink coffee
               after 3 pm. The bedroom should be as dark as possible for the brain
               must understand that it is night. Sunlight and artificial light make that
               melatonin secretion decreases and the brain thinks it is daytime. Avoid
               also bright light just before bedtime. What is the last most of
               us do right before we go to bed? Yes, we are on a strong footing
               illuminated bathroom and brushing our teeth before we go to bed with
               the mobile phone. Particularly unfortunate is the light from our mobile phones.
               Mobile screens transmit primarily 
               <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/blue-light">blue light</a> 
               into the brain via our eyes. The only natural source of
               blue light, as our brain understands, is the light from blue skies that
               signaling that it is daytime. The result is that it becomes difficult to
               sleep. Therefore, do not take your mobile phone into the bedroom.

               <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/children-and-sleep">recommended sleep length</a>

            </p>
            <br>
            <p> You suffer from FOMO ("fear of missing out"), and you just feel you MUST
                checking what is happening in the world around you, just before you go to sleep,
                at least change the light coming from the mobile phone from blue
                to red. Red light is interpreted by our Stone Age brain as light from a fire
                and that it is evening, which hinders to a lesser extent than blue light
                the brain from getting tired. This is a simple setting on the very
                most smartphones.<a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep"> The temperature</a> 
                in the bedroom should be a couple degrees lower than the room temperature elsewhere in the house, that is
                18-19 degrees Celsius. Deep sleep requires, among other things, that the body temperature drops to a
                couple of degrees when sleeping. Most people have probably noticed that
                it is easier to fall asleep in a room that is cold than in a room that is
                hot. The cool temperature in the bedroom helps to pull
                the body temperature towards deep sleep - the sleep we most want.
            </p>
            <p>Physical activity is another factor that can contribute to more sleep.
               It is documented that
               <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/exercise-and-sleep">regular exercise</a> 
               gives us longer and deeper sleep than a sedentary life. This
               probably due to the fact that we excrete a number of chemical substances
               which lowers the activity level in the brain (among other things in the sleep center)
               after we train. It stimulates sleep. A training ride
               also lowers stress levels and makes you less likely to stay
               lying down brooding, when you should really be sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>I recommend those who struggle to get enough sleep to try these
               the tips for a whole week. I am reasonably sure that you will feel it
               the body how important sufficient sleep is. Who couldn't
               imagine a little more energy, better memory, to feel more
               creative, and at the same time knowing that it reduces the risk of getting sick
               later in life?
