# Portfolio
Portfolio created as part of the Web Design 1 course at UiB. The project emphasizes responsive design, accessibility, and creative front-end solutions to showcase a strong foundation in modern web development principles. In this course, the focus was more on HTML and CSS, with less emphasis on JavaScript. As a result, my experience with JavaScript is limited, so I included the script directly within the HTML files.
